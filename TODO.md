# Frontend Challenge

## TODO
Develop a website to help kids pack from an upcoming trip to Disney Land Paris. The project is in partnership with American Tourister.

- [x]  Investigate design aesthetic of American Tourister's website.

    Nothing very interesting, despite having a designated section for Disney + Kids products, there are no custom design features.

- [x]  Investigate design aesthetic of Disneyland Paris's website.

    Lucky, seems to have a simple design aesthetic, relying heavily on placement images of characters and the location. Creating a compatible aesthetic for the weather app should be simple enough.



- [x]  Lookup common weather app interfaces.
- [x]  Sketch out basic layout for the app and its features.

- [x]  Find resource for weather icons.

    I might be able to get away with just using the Font Awesome free icons or Bootstrap ones.

    Ended up using bootstrap ones with OpenWeatherMap ones.

Given that the project can basically be solved with a well though-out SPA, Vue.js seems like a suitable option to use.

- [x]  Init and setup a new Vue.js app for the project.
- [ ]  Setup a repository for the project on GitHub.
- [x]  Blockout all the main front end features, get working prototype.
- [x]  Start adding and building custom styling.
- [x]  Optimize responsiveness for common screen resolutions.

- [x]  Investigate popular free weather forcaste APIs

    Opted to using OpenWeatherMap as the sole API.

- [x]  Integrate API with the project's front end.
